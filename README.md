# OON_Buttons

This code creates a 4x4 grid of interactive buttons that can be activated and deactivated by users. Clicking a button toggles its state and prints information about it, including a possible link to a GraphQL schema for further functionality. This simple interface could be used for various purposes, such as selecting options, activating features, or controlling connected systems.
